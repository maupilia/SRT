=====================
Discos from Scratch
=====================

Discos is the control software produced for the Sardinia Radio
Telescope, Medicina and Noto. It is a distributed system based on ACS (ALMA Common
Software), commanding all the devices of the telescope and allowing
the user to perform single-dish observations.

If the system has some problems that cannot be resolved with the help
of the previous section, you probably need to restart Discos. 

**Before restarting Discos, you have to follow the procedure of shutdown
of Discos.**
