$ : commands to insert in a shell

======================

#. Insert your project number

    ``> project=[projectID]`` |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`

#. Initial setup

    ``> antennaReset`` |logo| :numref:`srt_ACU_axis_blocked`

    ``> setupKKG``  |logo| :numref:`srt_receivers_KKG` |logo| :numref:`srt_ACU_green`

#. Select the active surface shape (Shaped configuration for K-band observations)

    ``> asSetup=S``  |logo| :numref:`srt_activesurface`

#. Insert the Local Oscillator value in MHz

    ``> setLO=[freq]`` |logo| :numref:`srt_receivers_KKG`

#. Select and configure the SARDARA backend in K-band

    ``> chooseBackend=Sardara``  |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`

    ``$ genericBackendTui BACKENDS/Sardara``

    ``> initialize=[code]``

     with :

       - ``[code]`` = SK00S : central feed only and full Stokes observations ;
       - ``[code]`` = SK00 : central feed only and total intensity observations ;
       - ``[code]`` = SK77S : 7 feeds and full Stokes observations ;
       - ``[code]`` = SK77 : 7 feeds and total intensity observations ;
       - ``[code]`` = SK03S : feeds 0 and 3 only and full Stokes observations ;
       - ``[code]`` = SK03 : feeds 0 and 3 only and total intensity observations ;
       - ``[code]`` = SK06S : feeds 0 and 6 only and full Stokes observations ;
       - ``[code]`` = SK06 : feeds 0 and 6 only and total intensity observations.

Important note: the *initialize* command requires a few more seconds comapared to the other command in order to operate.

#. Set the different parameters of the backend:

   ``> setSection=[sect],*,[bw],*,*,[sampleRate],[bin]``  |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend_KKG`

     with :

        - ``[sect]`` = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in full Stokes observations ;
        - ``[sect]`` = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,12, 13 in
          total intensity observations ;
        - ``[bw]`` the bandwidth in MHz (420 or 1500) ;
        - ``[sampleRate]`` in MHz (840 for 420 MKz of bw or 3000 for 1500 MHz of bw) ;
        - ``[bin]`` the frequency channels (1024 or 16384).

#. Choose the integration time in ms (e.g. n=10 corresponds to 100 spectra/sec)

   ``> integration=[n]``

#. If you want to use the multi-feed derotator to prevent field rotation during long acquisition, select the derotator configuration :

    ``> derotatorSetConfiguration=[config]``   with ``[config]`` = BSC, CUSTOM or FIXED.

        - BSC is for Best Coverage Space (automatic rotation of the
          dewar in order to best cover the scanned area).

        - CUSTOM : the user has to choose the angle of the dewar axis
          with the y-axis of the scanning frame that will be kept
          during the whole duration of the acquisition :
          ``>  derotatorSetPosition=[ang]d``     with ``[ang]`` the
          dewar angle in degrees.

        - FIXED : the dewar keeps a fixed postion w.r.t the horizon,
          no rotation is applied. To specify a static angle :
          ``>  derotatorSetPosition=[ang]d``     with ``[ang]`` the
          dewar angle in degrees.

..    To read back the position of the dewar :

    ``> derotatorGetPosition``

#. Put the antenna at 45 deg of elevation before to check that the signal is in the linear range of the backend:

    ``> goTo=*,45d`` |logo| :numref:`srt_mount`

#. Check that the getTpi command is working correctly before proceeding:

     ``> getTpi``
     
     If getTpi=0,0 then there is a problem, you need to ask for help. 
     If getTpi=(a few millions) then proceed.

#. Attenuate the signal based on the rms range [30;33] and check the value on the interface.

    ``> getRms``

    ``> setAttenuation=[sect],[att]``    with [att] the attenuation from 0 to 15 dB.  |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend_KKG`

    Important note 1: For the sections 0, 1, 2 and 3 (feeds 0 and 1), you have to set the attenuation accordingly to the values obtained with getRms. For the other sections the attenuation has to be set at 0 since the rms does not reach 30.

    Important note 2: The feed 10 does not work, do not consider the related    getRms and tsys values.


#. Check the tsys (typical values up to 100 K)

    ``> tsys`` |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend_KKG`

#. Report the ground temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed :

    ``> wx``

#. Follow the link below to perform the pointing and focus optimization (if not already included in your schedule) :

      :ref:`pointing-focus`

#. Begin the schedule by indicating the start scan [N] or subscan [N_n] in the SCD file :

    ``> startSchedule=[schedulename].scd,[N]`` |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`
