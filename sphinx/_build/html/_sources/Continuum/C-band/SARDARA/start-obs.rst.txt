#. Insert your project number :

    ``> project=[projectID]`` |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`


#. Initial setup :

    ``> antennaReset`` |logo| :numref:`srt_ACU_axis_blocked`

    ``> setupCCB`` |logo| :numref:`srt_receivers` |logo| :numref:`srt_ACU_green`

#. Select the active surface shape (Shaped configuration for C-band observations) :

    ``> asSetup=S`` |logo| :numref:`srt_activesurface`

#. Insert the Local Oscillator value in MHz :

    ``> setLO=[freq]`` |logo| :numref:`srt_receivers`

#. If you want to perform pointing and focus optimization and they not already included in your schedule, follow the link below :

       :ref:`pointing-focus`

#. Select and configure the SARDARA backend :

    ``> chooseBackend=Sardara`` |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`

    ``$ genericBackendTui BACKENDS/Sardara``

    ``> initialize=SC00S`` for full-Stokes observations or
    ``> initialize=SC00`` for total intensity observations.
    
    Important note: both SARDARA configurations SC00S and SC00 are set to work with a default bandwidth of 1500 MHz and 1024 channels. Only in the event that you wanted to observe with different bandwidth and/or channel values you have to set the parameters of the backend (see the following item).

#. Set the different parameters of the backend :

    ``> setSection=[sect],*,[bw],*,*,[sampleRate],[bin]`` |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend`

    with :

      - ``[sect]``: 0 in full-stokes observations and ``[sect]``: 0, 1 in total intensity observations ;
      - ``[bw]`` the bandwidth in MHz (420 or 1500 MHz) ;
      - ``[sampleRate]`` in MHz (840 for 420 MHz of bw or 3000 for 1500 MHz of bw) ;
      - ``[bin]`` the frequency channels (1024 or 16384).

#. Choose the integration time in ms (e.g. n=10 corresponds to 100 spectra/sec) :

     ``> integration=[n]``

#. Put the antenna at 45 deg of elevation before checking that the signal is in the linear range of the backend:

     ``> goTo=*,45d`` |logo| :numref:`srt_mount`

#. Check that the getTpi command is working correctly before proceeding:

     ``> getTpi``
     
     If getTpi=0,0 then there is a problem, you need to ask for help. 
     If getTpi=(a few millions) then proceed.

#. Attenuate the signal based on the rms range [20;22] and check the value on the interface :
     
     ``> getRms``  

     ``> setAttenuation=[sect],[att]``    with [att] the attenuation from 0 to 15 dB.  |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend`

#. Check the tsys (typical 30-35 K) :

     ``> tsys`` |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend`

#. Report the ground temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed :

     ``> wx``
     

#. Begin the schedule by indicating the start scan [N] or subscan [N_n] in the SCD file :

      ``> startSchedule=[schedulename].scd,[N]``  |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`
