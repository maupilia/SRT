   contain the root `toctree` directive.

======================

Your observations are now finished, we can stop the schedule and park
the antenna.

.. On nuraghe-obs1 ------------------

1. Stop your schedule :

   ``> haltSchedule``    *the schedule stops at the end of the on-going subscan.*  |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler_end`




2. Park the minor servo, active surface and antenna

   ``> goTo=180d,89d`` |logo| :numref:`srt_mount`

   ``> servoPark`` |logo| :numref:`srt_minorservo_end`

   ``> asPark`` |logo| :numref:`srt_activesurface_2`

   ``> antennaPark`` |logo| :numref:`srt_mount_antennareset`  |logo| :numref:`srt_ACU_stowpin`



Block the axes of the antenna
------------------------------

Look at the ACU monitor, wait until
**Axis blocked** appears in red. It can take a few minutes after the command
``> antennaPark`` has been given (:numref:`srt_ACU_axis_blocked`).

Only at this moment, you can press on the emergency stop button
(:numref:`srt_ACU_redbutton`).
