======================

The pointing and focus optimization requires the Total Power backend. Set first the parameters of the Total Power, then proceed with the pointing and focus procedures described below.


Total Power setup
=================

    ``> chooseBackend=TotalPower`` |logo| :numref:`srt_scheduler`
    
    Insert the bandwidth (300, 730, 1250 or 2000 MHz) and choose the sample rate (in MHz) :

    ``> setSection=0,*,[bw],*,*,[sampleRate],*`` |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend`

    ``> setSection=1,*,[bw],*,*,[sampleRate],*``
    
    Put the antenna at 45 deg of elevation and attenuate the signal in order to have the counts in the range [750-1100] : 
    
    ``> goTo=*,45d`` |logo| :numref:`srt_mount`

    ``> getTpi``
    
    ``> setAttenuation=[sect],[att]``    with [att] the attenuation from 0 to 15 dB.  |logo| :numref:`srt_genericBackend`



Recorder selection and Calibration tool display
==============================================

The pointing and focus need the calibration tool client and the selection of the correct recorder.

#. Choose the recorder :

    ``> chooseRecorder=MANAGEMENT/CalibrationTool``

#. Check if the calibrationtool client is open. If not, open it in a terminal to display the plots in real time :

    ``$ calibrationtoolclient MANAGEMENT/CalibrationTool``  |logo| :numref:`srt_calibrationtool`
    
    

Pointing
========

     The pointing optimization depends on the elevation of the sources. It is strongly
     recommended to perform it before observing a source (calibrators
     and target of your schedules).
     If the target you plan to observe is too weak to present a good S/N,
     select a calibrator bright enough and located close to your
     target (`see the internal report N°27 <http://www.oa-cagliari.inaf.it/area.php?page_id=10&skip=4>`_.).


#. Set the azimuth and elevation offsets to 0 degree.

    ``> azelOffsets=0d,0d``

#. Choose and track a proper calibrator.

    ``> track=[name]``  if the calibrator is in the SRT database
    (e.g. 3c147 => note **c** in lower case)

    otherwise  ``> sidereal=[name],[RA],[Dec],[epoch],[sector]``

    Important note: the complete list of the sources which are recorded in the     SRT database is available `on the page <https://discos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/srt/source/Appendix_D.html>`_

    * ``RA, Dec``: Pay attention to the coordinate formats:
      - decimal degrees, using a **d** suffix, for any coordinate (e.g. 30.00d)
      - sexagesimal degrees, with no suffix, for any coordinate (30:00:00)
      - hh:mm:ss, with a **h** suffix, for longitudes only (02:00:00h).

    * ``epoch``: 1950, 2000 or -1, the last one meaning that the
      provided coordinates are precessed to the observing epoch.

    * ``sector``: to force the cable wrap sector, if needed. Its value
      can be CW, CCW or neutral. Usually, use *neutral*.

     e.g. ``> sidereal=3c84,03:19:48.16h,41:30:42.1,2000,neutral``
     or   ``> sidereal=3c84,49.951d,41.512d,2000,neutral``


#. Set proper parameters according to your beamsize and coordinate frame in order to perform a correct pointing measurement :

    ``> crossScan=HOR,0.5d,00:00:20``

    * ``HOR`` or ``EQ`` frame: use the same coordinate frame as in the .lis of
      the schedule otherwise the  offsets will be rejected.

    * ``0.5d`` indicates the scan length in degrees (in this example 0.5°)

    * ``00:00:20`` indicates the duration of the scan (in this example: 20 seconds).

   Important note: in the event of not ideal weather conditions, you have to set a smaller scan length value of about 0.15d.


#. Look at the calibrationtool client to check the pointing offsets.

    Pointing offsets must be less than 1/10 of the beamsize (i.e. about < 0.005
    deg in C-band and < 0.00125 deg in K-band).


#. If you want to reject the measured offsets :

   ``> azelOffsets=0d,0d``

   and repeat the pointing scan procedure.


Focus
======

#. Choose and track a proper calibrator.

    ``> track=[name]``  if the calibrator is in the SRT database
    (e.g. 3c147 => note **c** in lower case)

    otherwise  ``> sidereal=[name],[RA],[Dec],[epoch],[sector]``

    Important note: the complete list of the sources which are recorded in the SRT database is available `on the page <https://discos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/srt/source/Appendix_D.html>`_

    * ``RA, Dec``: Pay attention to the coordinate formats:
      - decimal degrees, using a **d** suffix, for any coordinate (e.g. 30.00d)
      - sexagesimal degrees, with no suffix, for any coordinate (30:00:00)
      - hh:mm:ss, with a **h** suffix, for longitudes only (02:00:00h).

    * ``epoch``: 1950, 2000 or -1, the last one meaning that the
      provided coordinates are precessed to the observing epoch.

    * ``sector``: to force the cable wrap sector, if needed. Its value
      can be CW, CCW or neutral. Usually, use *neutral*.

     e.g. ``> sidereal=3c84,03:19:48.16h,41:30:42.1,2000,neutral``
     or   ``> sidereal=3c84,49.951d,41.512d,2000,neutral``
  
#. Cancel the previous focus position with:

   ``> clearServoOffsets``
   

#. Set proper parameters according to your beamsize :

   ``> focusScan=150,00:01:00``

    The first number should be three times the wavelength of
    observation in mm (e.g. in C-Band 3*5cm = 150mm). In the case of K-Band observations this value should be set to 60mm.

#. Look at the calibrationtool client to check the focus measurements. |logo| :numref:`srt_focus`

    The focus is correct if you see a Gaussian with an offset lower
    than a few tenth of  mm with respect to the zero.

#. If you want to reject the updated focus position with:

   ``> clearServoOffsets``

   and repeat the focus scan procedure.
